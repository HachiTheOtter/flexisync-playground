# Flexible Sync Playground

## Abstract

MongoDB has introduced [Flexible Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/data-access-patterns/flexible-sync/) for Realm apps: this sample application has two main purposes
1. Show in code the basics of dealing with Flexible Sync
2. Prove that it's possible to write a completely agnostic app: the code doesn't know anything about the backend, everything is configured by asking the user the relevant information
